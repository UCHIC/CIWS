## Cyberinfrastructure for Intelligent Water Supply (CIWS)

CIWS is a project funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation to develop cyberinfrastructure for smart water metering and high resolution water-use data collection. We are developing systems for high resolution residential water consumption data collection, processing and analysis.

This repository contains files and documentation for water use dataloggers under development to support a smart water metering effort at the Utah Water Research Laboratory at Utah State University. We are using low cost, commercially available, embedded computers and sensors to log data from existing analog residential water meters as well as commercial water meters with pulsed or current loop outputs (4-20 mA) on USU's campus. 

We are developing ways to turn most analog, positive displacement water meters with detachable registers into a smart water meter with capabilities to store high frequency flowrate data for up to a week or more in a battery run. We are also developing new cyberinfrastructure and techniques for collecting high frequency data from commercial water meters. 

The following is an example of the type of data we are collecting from individual residences:
