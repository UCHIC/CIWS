This folder holds the Python Scripts run by the Raspberry Pi Computer on the Hybrid Prototype.

Currently, the Raspberry Pi runs hybrid_logger_2.py. For this script to be run on startup, add the following line to /etc/rc.local:

sudo python /home/pi/hybrid_logger_2.py 

Note that this assumes the script is in the /home/pi/ directory.
The old version had two scripts, haltsig.py and hybrid_logger.py. The functionalities are now in one script.
