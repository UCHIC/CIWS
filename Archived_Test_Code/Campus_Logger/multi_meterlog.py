# This script makes high frequency measurements of flow through water meters
# installed on USU's student residence hall buildings at the Living Learning
# Center. It measures the 4-20 mA output of the Octave meters and the pulsed
# output from the multi-jet meters and converts them to gallons per minute.
# It then does the math to add the hot water inflow to the cold water inflow
# and then subtracts the hot water outflow. For each meter, it outputs flow
# rate, the incremental flow for each time period, and totalized flow since
# the program started.
#
# The sampling rate and data recording rate are configurable
