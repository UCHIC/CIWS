## Piggy Back Loggers Source Code 

This folder contains data logging source code for "Piggy-back" Loggers for Analog Meters. The "first_version" folder contains code originally written by Miguel Leonardo for a first prototype version of the piggy-back logger. The "current" folder contains the current code we are developing and using on Raspberry Pi's.

The code for the most recent power-efficient prototype is in the SD_Mag_LIS3MDL_Prototype/Firmware folder. This version runs on an ATmega328p and reads data with a magnetometer instead of a hall-effect sensor. Recommend use this version.
