## Cyberinfrastructure for Intelligent Water Supply Source Code 

This folder contains both data logging source code for two systems we were using to conduct water meter data collection efforts and data visualization and analysis source code for the resulting data. The data logging code was created for execution on hardware created by the Utah Water Research Laboratory at Utah State University using low cost, commercially available embedded computers (e.g., Raspberry Pi) and low cost sensors. 

The following are descriptions of the two data logging systems:

1. **"Piggy-back" Loggers for Analog Meters**:  We are using low cost, embedded computers and components to "piggy-back" on top of analog, positive displacement water meters to collect high frequency data.

2. **Loggers for Current Output Meters**: For this effort we are using low-cost, embedded computers to log high frequency data from 4-20 mA or pulsed outputs on commercial water meters installed on residential buildings on USU's campus.
