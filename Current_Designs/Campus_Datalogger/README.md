The Campus Dataloggers were designed to measure the 4-20 mA current loop output of the water meters in Utah State University's Campus buildings.

There are two current versions of the Campus Datalogger. One is equipped to measure one water meter (a common configuration on USU's campus) and the other is equipped to measure three water meters as well as the temperature of the water pipes. Two of the meters are current loop output meters, and the third is a pulsed output meter. The pulsed output meter measures hot return flow, while the other two meters measure hot in and cold in flow.
