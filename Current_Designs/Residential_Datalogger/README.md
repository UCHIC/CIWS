The Residential Datalogger is designed to read magnetic field information from a magnetometer attached to a magnetically-driven positive-displacement water meter. The data is then processed into magnetic pulses per 4-second period. This data is stored on an SD Card, and can be read from a personal computer. Configuration is done over a serial interface.

It is recommended that the magnetic signal be characterized to ensure the success of the device. A simple setup to accomplish this characterization will be included in this repository soon.
