## Sensor Placement
The location of the Hall effect sensor plays an important role when tapping in between water meters and their analog registers. During experimental trials we found that the wrong placement of the sensor can result in inaccurate counts of the pulses generated by the water meter. We determined that the Hall effect sensor needs to be placed on the meter using the guidelines shown in the below, in order to obtain accurate counts of the magnetic pulses generated by the meter.
