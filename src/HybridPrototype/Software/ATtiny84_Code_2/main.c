	/*===========================================*\
	| The main function	for the Residential   |
	| Piggy-Back CIWS Meterloggers. An ATtiny84   |
	| reads pulses from a residential water meter |
	| and prepares the data to be read by a       |
	| Raspberry Pi Embedded Computer. The ATtiny  |
	| controls when the Raspberry Pi is on or off |
	| to reduce power consumption. The aim is to  |
	| keep the Raspberry Pi's computing power but |
	| reduce the power consumption of the device. |
	|					      |
	| This is accomplished as follows:            |
	|                                             |
	| 1) Initialization:                          |
	|			      	              |
	|      The Raspberry Pi's power controlling   |
	|      hardware is initialized.               |
	|            				      |
	|      Interrupt INT0 is initialized. INT0 is |
	|      triggered by a pulse from the water    |
	|      meter. INT0 also begins initialization |
	|      of the timer interrupt.                |
	|					      |
	|      The EEPROM interface is initialized.   |
	|      The EEPROM interface uses I2C to write |
	|      collected data to an external EEPROM   |
	|      chip to be read by the Raspberry Pi.   |
	|	   				      |
	|      The Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)  |
	|      is initialized. The ADC is used to     |
	|      monitor battery voltage.		      |
	|					      |
	|      The timer is initialized with an       |
	|      interrupt to trigger every four        |
	|      seconds.				      |
	|                                             |
	| 2) Main loop:				      |
	|					      |
	|      In the main loop, the program will     |
	|      check to see if the EEPROM is "full".  |
	|      If so, the program will turn on the    |
	|      Raspberry Pi and turn it back off when |
	|      the Raspberry Pi is finished. Updating |
	|      data points and writing to the EEPROMs |
	|      is handled by interrupts.              |
	|      The Raspberry Pi is also turned on     |
	|      when a button is pushed. The ATtiny84  |
	|      sets a signal on PA4 to tell the RPi   |
	|      to stay on and not turn itself off.    |
	|      The user is in charge of shutting down |
	|      the Rasperry Pi. This allows a user    |
	|      to pull data files from the Raspb. Pi. |
	|                                             |
	|      Eventually, it may be prudent to put   |
	|      the microcontroller to sleep and wake  |
	|      it up with interrupts.                 |
	|                                             |
